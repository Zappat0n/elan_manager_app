# Rails Programming

## PROJECT: Elan Manager

## Introduction

Web application to keep track of your school scores grouped by subject.
You can create as many subjects as you want and start to save there all your scores. <br>
You can create different exercises with their score, and keep them as external (without any group) or assigned to a group. <br>
You can see your average score for all your grouped presentations, all your external presentations, and for all the presentations included in one group.

I have used different concepts of Ruby on Rails including:

- Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Routing
- Migrations
- View
- RESTful design
- Authentication system with Devise
- Active Storage
- TDD
- Heroku deployment
- Adding gems for extra features
